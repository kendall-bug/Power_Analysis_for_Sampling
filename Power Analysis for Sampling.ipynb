    "# Effect Size - Cohen's d:\n",
    "A metric that measures the size of the difference observed between samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, we will need to suggest the observed effect size in order to obtain the minimum sample size for that effect size to return a statistically significant result at a desired level of statistical power (https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/power-tests.html).\n",

    "### Rule of thumb for interpreting Cohen's d\n",
    "#### From: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/cohens-d/\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these general “rule of thumb” guidelines (which Cohen said should be used cautiously):\n",
    "\n",
    " - Small effect = 0.2\n",
    " - Medium Effect = 0.5\n",
    " - Large Effect = 0.8\n",
    " \n",
    "“Small” effects are difficult to see with the naked eye. For example, Cohen reported that the height difference \n",
    "between 15-year-old and 16-year-old girls in the US is about this effect size. “Medium” is probably big enough to \n",
    "be discerned with the naked eye, while effects that are “large” can definitely be seen with the naked eye \n",
    "(Cohen calls this “grossly perceptible and therefore large”). For example, the difference in heights between \n",
    "13-year-old and 18-year-old girls is 0.8. An effect under 0.2 can be considered trivial, even if your results \n",
    "are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that a “large” effect isn’t necessarily better than a “small” effect, especially in settings where \n",
    "small differences can have a major impact. For example, an increase in academic scores or health grades by an effect \n",
    "size of just 0.1 can be very significant in the real world. Durlak (2009) suggests referring to prior research in \n",
    "order to get an idea of where your findings fit into the bigger context."
